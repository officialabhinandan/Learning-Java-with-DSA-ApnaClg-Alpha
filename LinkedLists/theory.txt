🔴🟠🟡 LinkedList:- In simple word, LinkedList is a linear data structure where we connect the data elements/nodes with the help of chains/links. Actually
a linked list is a chain of data nodes or elements which are interconnected with a link or chain. If we visualize every single nodes of a LinkedList
we notice that a node or data element has two parts. First part stores the data. It may be integer, float, boolean, long or string type. Second part 
consists of next or reference or pointer which is actually points towards the next node. It links the next node. In case of last node, the next pointer
referes to null. 

🛑 In Java we use a reference variable in the place of next, which is a reference to the next node because their is no concept of pointer in Java 
unlike c or c++. Basically reference variable is a type of variable(also read in OOPs) that points to an object. Here the object is the node(next node).

🛑 So to create a LinkedList, we need to make NODE class where every nodes are the onject of the class NODE. Another reason to put all nodes inside the
NODE class is that each node stores same type of informations (data and ref to the next node). So apperantly we know the blueprint of the node.  
Using that we can make a central NODE class which carries all the proparties of each node present in the LinkedList. Each individual node is the 
object of that NODE class. Now we'll apply the concept of OOPs to build this data structure. 

class Node{
    int data;
    Node next; // data type is itself the class type (bcz the next variable is pointing towards the object of the next node)
    
    // defining constructor
    public Node(int data){
        this.data = data; // this.data is present inside the class Node
        this.next = null; // at starting point we assume that it isn't pointing towards any other node
    }
}
🛑 So, to create a single node we need to create an object of the Node inside the LinkedList class.
🛑 We keep track two of the most important or special nodes in a linkedlist. 
    ⚪ Head Node (1st node) and, 
    ⚪ Tail Node (last node before null).
🛑 If we have data of the head and tail node, we can traverse throughout the linkedlist using the data of the next.
🛑 We can access one node at a time in a linkedlist.
   in a linkedlist.
🛑 At the last node, the next points towards the null. In case we have a linkedlist consists of a single node, the head and the tail points
to the same node. In that case head equals to tail.

🛑🛑🛑 To add node at first of a linkedlist :- // T.C = O(1)
    ⚪ First, we create a node and check if there is any further node available to connect to not using the next variable.
    ⚪ If no next node is found, we make the same node head and tail both.
    ⚪ But if another node is available to link, at first we link both the nodes using next refence variable.
    ⚪ Whenever we type newNode.next = head; we store the address of the head variable (not the value) inside the next refence variable of the newNode.
    ⚪ Atlast we declare the newly added node as head.

🛑🛑🛑 To add node at last of a linkedlist :-  // T.C = O(1)
    ⚪ Create a new node (newNode),
    ⚪ Check wheather the linkedlist is empty or not. In that case declare the node as tail as well as head node. The next varibale is by default 
        pointed towards null. 
    ⚪ Tail's next = new Node
    ⚪ tail = new Node.

🛑🛑🛑 To print a LinkedList :-  // T.C = O(n)
    ⚪ Check the ll is empty or not(head == null). In that case print null.
    ⚪ Create a temporary node and store the value of head inside it(Node temp = head)
    ⚪ Now run a while loop untill temp != null and print temp.data(Sysout(temp.data + " ")) and move towards the next Node(temp = temp.next).

🛑🛑🛑 To add node at middle of a linkedlist :- // T.C = O(n)
    ⚪ If we try to insert at index 0, call addFirst(data) and return.
    ⚪ Create a new Node to insert (Node newNode = new Node(data)) and make another new Node temp and assign it as head(Node temp = head).
    ⚪ Create i(int i=0) variable to track the index while traversing throughout the ll.
    ⚪ Run while loop and traverse the temp node (temp = temp.next) throughout the ll untill i<index-1.
    ⚪ while i reaches to previous node connect newNode's next with the next node (newNode.next = temp.next).
    ⚪ And connect temp with the new Node (temp.next = newNode).
